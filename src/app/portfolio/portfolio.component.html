          <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
          <p>
            My personal portfolio website that I decided to build myself
            rather than using Wordpress, Square, Wix, or similar services.
          </p>
          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>
            A static website built using Angular and deployed using AWS Amplify.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the styling and design was done by myself using Bootstrap 4, but I also used some
            of Chris Dermody's design and code that he was giving away for free. You can view his code

            An Android app similar to Twitter that I built for a class project.
