          <p>
            Hi, I'm Cameron Brown. I'm a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments. I graduated
            with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in April 2022 and have been working at Fidelity
            as a Software Engineer ever since. In my two years as a professional developer, I have mostly
            worked as a front-end developer developing business applications using Angular and TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. Outside of work, I enjoy watching soccer and football. 
            My favorite teams are Real Salt Lake and Tottenham Hotspur. I also enjoy spending time with my
            wife and dog, playing sports, reading, and playing video games.
          </p>
