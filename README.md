# My Portfolio Website

This is the code for Cameron Brown's Portfolio Website which can be viewed at https://www.cameronjoebrown.com.

## How It Was Built

This is just a static website built using Angular and styled using Bootstrap with
some styling coming from Chris Dermody. You can view his code
[here](https://github.com/Chippd/chippd.github.io). There is no backend.

## Deployment
AWS Amplify is being used to manage/automate deployments because it is simple.
